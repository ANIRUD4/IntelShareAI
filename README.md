# CoSenseAI
This project presents an interactive, open-source system designed to make creating and using AI models accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise. The device allows users to switch between training and function modes: in training mode, AI learns through simple feedback (correct/incorrect responses) using inputs from a camera and microphone; in function mode, it applies the learned model in real-world scenarios such as recognizing people, objects, or voices. Trained models can be exported and shared, enabling community-driven datasets and reusable AI solutions. By simplifying model creation and fostering collaborative knowledge-sharing, the system lowers barriers to AI adoption and demonstrates social impact in domains such as education, accessibility, and small-scale businesses.
